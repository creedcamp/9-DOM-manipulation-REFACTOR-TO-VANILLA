          Twas the night Before Christmas When all through the house Not a
          creature was stirring Not even a mouse The stockings all hung By the
          chimney with care In hopes That St. Nicholas Soon would be there

          Winter is here again oh lord, Haven't been home in a year or more I
          hope she holds on a little longer Sent a letter on a long summer day
          Made of silver, not of clay I've been runnin' down this dusty road
          Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin' I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
          Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'

        Here's a llama, There's a llama, and another little llama, Fuzzy llama,
        Funny llama, llama, llama, Duck. llama, llama, Cheesecake llama, Tablet,
        brick, potato, llama, llama, llama, Mushroom llama, llama, llama, Duck,
        I was once a treehouse I lived in a cake But I never saw the way The
        orange slayed the rake I was only three years dead But it told a tale
        And now listen, little child To the safety rail.
